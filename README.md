<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is done as a part of capstone project of Summer Analytics 2022, a primer course on Data Science, conducted by Consulting and Analytics Club of IIT Guwahati.

Today's online retail platforms are heavily powered by algorithms and applications that use AI. Machine learning is used in a variety of ways, from inventory control and quality assurance in the warehouse to product recommendations and sales demographics on the website.
<br>

In this project I have estimated the discounted price of different products listed on Amazon and Flipkart, from the descriptions of products, including details like product title, ratings, reviews, and actual prices. 

## Acknowledgement 
I would highly acknowledge the Consulting and Analytics Club of IIT Guwahati for conducting this hackathon.
